# Time Loss Calculator

A simple web-based calculator to estimate the time loss incurred when driving at various speeds, compared to driving at a maximum speed. This tool helps you understand how much time you lose when you decrease your driving speed in increments of 10 km/h.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Input your maximum driving speed and get instant results.
- **Detailed Time Loss Calculation**: Provides time loss in minutes and seconds for each speed decrement.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Maximum Speed**: Input the maximum speed you usually drive at.
2. **Calculate**: Click on the "Calculate" button.
3. **View Results**: See the time loss for each 10 km/h decrement in an easy-to-read format.

## Example

If you enter a maximum speed of 120 km/h, the calculator will show you the time lost when driving at speeds of 110 km/h, 100 km/h, 90 km/h, etc., compared to driving at 120 km/h for one hour.

| Speed (km/h) | Time Loss                  |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| 110          | 5 minutes and 27 seconds   |
| 100          | 12 minutes and 0 seconds   |
| 90           | 20 minutes and 0 seconds   |
| 80           | 30 minutes and 0 seconds   |
