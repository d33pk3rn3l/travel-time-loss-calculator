# Time Loss Calculator

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-brightgreen)](https://d33pk3rn3l.github.io/travel-time-loss-calculator/travel-time-loss-calculator.html)

A simple web-based calculator to estimate the time loss incurred when driving at various speeds, compared to driving at a maximum speed. This tool helps you understand how much time you lose when you decrease your driving speed in increments of 10 km/h.

## Motivation

I built the Time Loss Calculator as a hobby project to help drivers see the real impact of their speed choices on travel time and fuel efficiency. The idea came from research showing how driving faster significantly reduces fuel efficiency. 

This tool visualizes the trade-off between speed and time loss, helping you make smarter driving decisions. It's all about finding that sweet spot where you save fuel without adding too much travel time. I wanted a simple, web-based solution where you could quickly see how much time you lose when you reduce your speed in 10 km/h increments, making it easy to understand and practical for everyday use.

For more insights into the relationship between driving speed, fuel economy, and cost savings, check out [FuelEconomy.gov](https://www.fueleconomy.gov) and [Energy Efficient Driving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-efficient_driving#Maintaining_an_efficient_speed).

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Input your maximum driving speed and get instant results.
- **Detailed Time Loss Calculation**: Provides time loss in minutes and seconds for each speed decrement.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Maximum Speed**: Input the maximum speed you usually drive at.
2. **Calculate**: Click on the "Calculate" button.
3. **View Results**: See the time loss for each 10 km/h decrement in an easy-to-read format.

## Example

If you enter a maximum speed of 120 km/h, the calculator will show you the time lost when driving at speeds of 110 km/h, 100 km/h, 90 km/h, etc., compared to driving at 120 km/h for one hour.

| Speed (km/h) | Time Loss                  |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| 110          | 5 minutes and 27 seconds   |
| 100          | 12 minutes and 0 seconds   |
| 90           | 20 minutes and 0 seconds   |
| 80           | 30 minutes and 0 seconds   |
